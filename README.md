Growing up across seven countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe has developed my curiosity and open-mindedness, igniting my passion for advocacy. I am pursuing a Master of Management Analytics at McGill University to start my own social business.

Striving to find my purpose, I want to create the basis for a caring, ethical, and sustainable world. I moved around throughout my upbringing, allowing me to see how people live, what matters to them, and, most importantly, what they lack. This experience created my desire for action, pushing me to fight for societal prosperity, sustainable evolution, and foreign empowerment. Coupling my curiosity and desire to make a difference, I am undertaking an MMA at McGill University to build the base for research methods and data science to leverage these tools within the sphere of Social Business
