# 🌍 You are in the right place for change! 🌱

I am **Félix**, a young man who grew up in **seven countries** across **Sub-Saharan Africa**, **Central Asia**, and **Eastern Europe**. Living within these different systems shaped my curiosity and understanding of how systems influence livelihoods. I pay attention to what works, what breaks, and how we can build better.

### 💪 What will I do about it?
I’m pursuing social entrepreneurship, building skills and partnerships to create businesses that improve lives while building a new benchmark of systems we can depend on. 
My toolset is practical analytics, including forecasting, production planning, and optimization, that turns messy reality into clear, weekly decisions.

### ✨ Philosophy
Striving to find my purpose, I aim to lay the groundwork for a caring, ethical, and sustainable world. I will use my skills in data analytics to support social and environmental causes. Moving around the world has allowed me to see how people live, what matters to them, and, most importantly, what they lack. This experience sparked my desire for action, motivating me to advocate for societal prosperity, sustainable development, and global empowerment.
My approach is simple: measure what matters, respect real constraints, and design decision systems that teams can run.

### 🤝 Ethics
I will fight using only my **brain** and **skills** to benefit our planet and **social health**. 🌿  
All humans and animals are **living beings** and will be treated with **dignity** and **respect**. 🤗

### 🔥 What Now?
If you’re building something small, mission-driven, and close to the field, especially in food or farming, I’d love to connect and explore how I can help.
